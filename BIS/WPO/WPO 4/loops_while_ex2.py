Exercise While Loops - Nearest Square

Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than 
an integerlimit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. 
A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, 
for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.
"""

limit = 40

# write your while loop here

number = 0
nearest_square = 0

while ((number+1)**2) < limit:
    number += 1
    nearest_square = number * number

print(nearest_square)
