Count Unique Words

Find the number of unique words in the text.
Complete these three steps to get your answer:
1. Split sentence into a list of words. 
Hint: You can use a string method you learned in the previous lesson.
2. Convert the list into a data structure that would keep only the unique
elements from the list.
3. Print the length of the container.
